Single ended Linked-List from Scratch

The linked list is a recursive set of objects stored within objects.
'Head' is the first node therefore it is the largest object (longest chain of objects within objects)
'Current' is an inclusive subset of 'Head' ie. A chain from any given node to the end of the chain
