A Map is an interface

A Map (unlike a Set) is a collection of key/value pairs stored in a certain fashion
A List can be seen as a type of map where the list index is the key.

Maps are ideal when counting occurrences. Sets are ideal when checking occurrences
Maps are superior because a Map can be seen as a set with extra functionality (counting the elements)
A map can be used as a set if needs be, but not the other way around.


3 types of Maps can be extended from the Map interface 

1. HashMap
2. LinkedHashMap
3. TreeMap

HashMap 		: Order is not preserved and is random 
LinkedHashMap	: Ordered version of the HashSet (ordered by insertion)
TreeMap			: Ordered version of the HashSet (Ordered by default)

Due to the way the data is stored in the set, the way data is retrieved is different
