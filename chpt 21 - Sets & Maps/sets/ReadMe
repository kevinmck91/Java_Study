A Set is an interface

A Set is a collection of elements stored in a certain fashion. 

A set cannot store duplicates hence should be used to check for an occurrence of a object 

3 types of sets can be extended from the set interface 

1. HashSet
2. LinkedHashSet
3. TreeSet

HashSet 		: Order is not preserved and is random 
LinkedHashSet	: Ordered version of the HashSet (ordered by insertion)
TreeSet			: Ordered version of the HashSet (Ordered by default)

Due to the way the data is stored in the set, the way data is retrieved is different
