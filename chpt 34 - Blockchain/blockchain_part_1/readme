Simple BlockChain _ Part 1

The chain of blocks is stored in an array. Each block is linked to the following block by mean of a hash function
(Similar to the way a link in a linkedList is linked to the next link via a pointer)

Everytime a block is created, it is instantly assigned a hash based on the information it holds 
(Timestamp, data, previous hash & current hash)

This way, the entire blockchain can be created almost instantly ie. someone can create a fake block with a fake hash and create a fake blockchain instantly

We need a way to slow down the way the blocks are created - Block Mining

We create a difficulty level that means multiple computations are processed every time a block is created.
This way, a person who created a fake block would need to compute the whole chain 
(ie. they would need more computational power than all peers in order to create a valid chain, which is impossible)
